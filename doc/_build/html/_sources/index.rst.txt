**Problem Spec**

When a new Fellow joins Andela they are assigned an office space and an optional living space if they choose to opt in.
When a new Staff joins they are assigned an office space only.
An office can accommodate a maximum of 6 people. A living space can accommodate a maximum of 4 people.
The goal of the project is to digitize and randomize a room allocation system for one of Andela Kenyaâ€™s facilities called The Dojo.

It is implemented as a command line program which can be run in any terminal (UNIX or Windows) to add
persons, create rooms plus a host of other functions.
